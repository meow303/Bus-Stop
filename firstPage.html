        <p>When you wake up, the first thing you notice is the streetlight and how 
            bright it is in contrast with the dark night.</p>
        <p>Then, pushing yourself up from the bench, you notice the sign. A pale green plate with
             a symbol of a bus. Under the icon, it reads: 309, 423, 667. You blink twice and realize: you're at a bus stop.
