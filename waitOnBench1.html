        <h1>Waiting on the bench...</h1>

        <p>You feel uncomfortable and disoriented. How long were you out for? Whatever. You sit upright
         and face the empty road streched out infront of you. Somewhere in the distance, you hear 
         crickets chirruping and wonder how you even got here. None of your surroundings look familar
         and you can't recall when or why you left home. It's God knows how late at night and the cold
         bites you through your coat. Speaking of... you slowly reach into one of your coat pockets. Your 
         fingers touch something hard and cold in your left pocket --- your phone. You fish it out and try 
         to power it on. Your homescreen finally pops up after a few seconds of dizzying unresponsiveness.</p>
        
         <p>"Oh no!" you mumble when you see the sliver of red in the corner of your screen. Your phone 
         is at 10% power. 
         </p>

         <p>use your phone's GPS</p>
         <p>power it off</p>
